HDGS
====

HDGS is an abstraction layer (representing time dependent graphs, 
as well as time series of node or link propeties) on top of HDFS and HBase, 
to connect the HDGSworkspace - a toolbox for processing, transforming and 
filtering graphs and networks into the hadoop ecosystem. It is not intendet 
to be a nother machine learning tool (therefor we have Mahout), but it will 
combine several existing concepts or tools like: GraphLab, Neo4J, Titan, 
HAMA, Giraph, Mahout and others in to on place.
